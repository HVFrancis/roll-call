roll-call is a project which reads a standard Roll Call attendance report and counts the 
number of times present, absent, late, and the last date attendend, and returns that
as a cvs string.

The file roll_call_report.cvs is a sample report file (generated by ChatGPT for me... thanks OpenAI!)

The file ariths105.txt is the output from this program.

Right now the program take the report file as a command line arguement and prints the string,
which can be redirected to a cvs file.
